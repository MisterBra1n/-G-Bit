# About This Project
This project is a CLI git-like version control system based off the high level description provided in the YouTube video "Version Control (Git)" by the Missing Semester.
### Topics I Got to Explore Through This Project:
- Huffman coding and lossless data encryption algorithms
- Advanced IO: how to write single bits to a file as opposed to whole bytes
- Encryption using SHA256 and the deterministic nature of hashing functions
- Writing command line programs in Golang
